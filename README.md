# Project Title

This project aims to deliver time series predictive model for major assets: Tesla (TSLA), Vanguard
Total Bond Market ETF (BND), and S&P 500 ETF (SPY); to enhance customer portfolio
performance, minimize risks, and capitalize on market opportunities. This is achieved through the
use of YFinance Library for historical financial information extraction such as stock prices.
